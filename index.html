                <p>My coding career began as an accident. It was 1999, I was a scared young adult about to graduate from college
                    with a degree in Psychology. During my last semester of college, I took a course in Teaching BioPsychology
                    and my professor decided that the teaching focus of the course was going to be through an online learning
                    platform. For my final project, I built an interactive web page for teaching about how the nose worked
                    in tandem with the brain to give us a sense of smell. This was my first interaction with building anything
                    on the internet and frankly,I still used dial-up at home. Little did I know that my future would take
                    me in a roundabout way to a career of coding.</p>

                        <p>I am presently a beginner at coding. I am extremely green and I believe this gives me an advantage.
                            I am flexible, eager to learn, and not afraid to make mistakes; all excellent qualities of a
                            web developer. This portfolio contains the steps along my journey.</p>
